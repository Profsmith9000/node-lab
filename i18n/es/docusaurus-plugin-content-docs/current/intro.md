# Workshop Introduction

Welcome to the Cardano Node Workshop! This hands-on workshop, presented by Input Output, will guide you through setting up and using a Cardano node. Over the next 4 hours, you'll learn essential skills for working with the Cardano blockchain using our mobile node lab.

## Workshop Environment

You'll be working on a dedicated Raspberry Pi 5 from our mobile node lab. These devices are pre-configured to help you focus on learning core Cardano node operations rather than initial setup challenges.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up and syncing a `cardano-node` using `mithril`
- Creating and managing keys and addresses
- Executing transactions on the Preview network
- Configuring logging for effective monitoring
- (If there is time): Configuring `kupo` and `ogmios`

## Prerequisites

- Basic command line experience
- Familiarity with blockchain concepts
- SSH client for connecting to your assigned Raspberry Pi

## Workshop Format

This is a practical, hands-on session where you'll work directly with Cardano tools and infrastructure on your assigned node. Each participant will have dedicated hardware to experiment with throughout the workshop.
